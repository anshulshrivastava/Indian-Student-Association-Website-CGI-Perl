<h3>How to reach Bradley University?</h3>
<h3>By Air</h3>
<p>Peoria city has its own domestic airport called as Greater Peoria Airport. The <b>nearest International airport</b> is O'Hare International Airport Chicago. Students normally come from India to this airport and from there take a bus to come to Peoria. You can take a plane ride from Chicago International airport to Peoria which can handle only small planes. For more information on how to get the booking done, ask your travel agent. However, <b>we don't recommend</b> you to travel by air from Chicago. We will let you know more easy way.</p>
<h3>By Bus (<b>This is the safest way to reach Bradley University</b>)</h3>
<p>Bradley University has special arrangement with Peoria Charter Bus company which runs daily from peoria to chicago and visa versa. Flights from India usually land at Terminal #5 of O'Hare airport. At terminal #5, after you complete your normal procedures with INS and other officials, just outside you will find a information counter. From the counter you will have information of Peoria Charter bus company. Right from morning, about 5 buses are coming to Bradley University Student Center. We will be there to pick you up- if you tell us in advance.</p>
<p>The bus fare is $39 for students. Be sure to tell the bus driver that you are a student of you will end up with more bus fare. For bus schedule and information about Peoria Charter just go to http://www.peoriacharter.com/tickets/?mrkt=ds.</p>
<h3>By Train</h3>
<p>Peoria don't have its own railway station. The Closest Railway Station is BLOOMINGTON-NORMAL (BNL) which is about 36 miles (actually 35.78 miles). Again, don't do this, since you have to take either a bus or have to come through taxi (<b>expensive!!!</b>) to peoria.</p>

<h4>Winter&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Sweaters - both light and heavy are <b>absolutely essential </b>for winter, when the temperatures drop well below the 0&deg;C mark. A heavy jacket with a hood, gloves, woolen socks, ear-muffs and monkey caps are also very useful. Thermal (woolen) undergarments are highly recommended from India. However, it is a better idea to buy your winter jackets here. Peoria is subject to<b> frequent changes in weather</b> and expect rain at any time, so don't forget to get an umbrella or a raincoat. A pair of good water-proof boots like the Woodland brand would also be very useful</p>
<h4>Summer&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Summer is warm, almost hot and very humid. It's the time to wear T-shirts, shorts, etc. Cottons are quite expensive here unless you find a good deal or blow out sale. So, you might want to get some from home.
